The remaining bits 9 through 11 are not used by the processor, and are free for the OS to store some of its own accounting information. In addition, when P is not set, the processor ignores the rest of the entry and you can use all remaining 31 bits for extra information, like recording where the page has ended up in swap space.

3.4.3 The First-In, First-Out (FIFO) Page Replacement Algorithm
As a page replacement algorithm, the same idea is applicable. The operating
system maintains a list of all pages currently in memory, with the most recent arrival at the tail and the least recent arrival at the head. On a page fault, the page at
the head is removed and the new page added to the tail of the list.
