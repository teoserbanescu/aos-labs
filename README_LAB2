We implemented the logic for page table management but we are not able to test it,
as we encounter multiple bugs in the first part of the initialization.

Unfortunately, we are stuck fixing some of the issues. One big issue that we had was
that the kernel was failing everytime when loading cr3. It turned out that we had
a problem in the boot allocator which caused many issues in the allocated pages.

The pages are still not correct, even though tests for lab 1 pass.

We will continue to work on it and hopefully fix it soon, but have decided to submit
what we have now, too.
